## About me

I graduated in physics from the University of Buenos Aires, in Argentina. This is a combined degree covering what European universities cover in a BSc and MSc in Physics.

I did a PhD in Philosophy at the University of Leeds, in the UK. My thesis was on fundational issues related to realist interpretations of quantum mechanics.

I'm now excited about learning data science, visualization and machine learning methods.
