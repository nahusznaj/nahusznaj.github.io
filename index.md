I graduated in physics from the University of Buenos Aires, in Argentina. This qualification is similar to a combined BSc and MSc from the EU.

I completed a PhD in Philosophy of Science at the University of Leeds, in the UK, in January 2017. My thesis was on foundational issues relating to realist interpretations of quantum mechanics. Then, I was a postdoc researcher at the National University of Ireland Galway, in Ireland, during 2017-2018. After this period, I decided to make a career change.

I worked in Twilio in the amazing team of Technical Support. Now I'm working in an even more awesom organization, at ASAPP.com.
