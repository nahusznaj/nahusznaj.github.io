## Bio

I graduated in physics from the University of Buenos Aires, in Argentina. This is a degree in Physics similar to a combined European BSc and MSc.

I did a PhD in Philosophy of Science at the University of Leeds, in the UK. My thesis was on foundational issues relating to realist interpretations of quantum mechanics.

I'm a postdoc researcher at the National University of Ireland Galway. 

I'm learning data science, data visualisation and machine learning methods.

In this website that I made with [minimal_mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), I will show projects I'm working on, and post info about my learning path.
