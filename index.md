Since 01/2019, I've been working at Twilio in the Developer Technical Support team.

I graduated in physics from the University of Buenos Aires, in Argentina. This degree in physics is similar to a combined BSc and MSc.

I did a PhD in Philosophy of Science at the University of Leeds, in the UK. My thesis was on foundational issues relating to realist interpretations of quantum mechanics.

I was a postdoc researcher at the National University of Ireland Galway. 

I made this page with [minimal_mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
