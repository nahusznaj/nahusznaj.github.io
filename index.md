I graduated in physics from the University of Buenos Aires, in Argentina. This is a combined degree and it is similar to the European BSc and MSc in Physics.

I did a PhD in Philosophy of Science at the University of Leeds, in the UK. My thesis was on foundational issues relating to realist interpretations of quantum mechanics.

I'm now excited about learning data science, data visualisation and machine learning methods.
