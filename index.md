I'm a Support Engineer at Twilio.

I graduated in physics from the University of Buenos Aires, in Argentina. This degree in physics is similar to a combined European BSc and MSc.

I did a PhD in Philosophy of Science at the University of Leeds, in the UK. My thesis was on foundational issues relating to realist interpretations of quantum mechanics.

I was a postdoc researcher at the National University of Ireland Galway. 

I made with [minimal_mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
