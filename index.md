I graduated in physics from the University of Buenos Aires, in Argentina. This qualification is similar to a combined BSc and MSc from the EU.

I completed a PhD in Philosophy of Science at the University of Leeds, in the UK, in January 2017. My thesis touched on foundational issues relating to realist interpretations of quantum mechanics. Then, I was a postdoc researcher at the National University of Ireland Galway, in Ireland, during 2017-2018. After this study and research period, I decided to make a career change.

I worked in Twilio in the amazing team of Technical Support for developers. Currently, I'm working at the incredible <ASAPP.com>, helping companies succeed with an kick-ass AI-based contact centre solution for chat, SMS, and voice calls.
