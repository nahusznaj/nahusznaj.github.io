# Exploratory analysis on distribution of scholarships

This is an exploration on distribution of scholarships. The data is not publicly available and I have created fantasy labels/names to keep the results anonymised.

The data-set includes each application for a scholarship. Each application has information such as an applications ID, the name of the applicant, the discipline of the proposed research project, the host university, the project title, and, crucially, the status of the application: whether it is successful or not.

The idea of this analysis is to visualise how the scholarships are distributed across disciplines and universities.
