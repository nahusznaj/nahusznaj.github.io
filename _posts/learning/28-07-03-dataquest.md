I'm doing the course _Data Scientist In Python_.

In this (repo)[https://github.com/nahusznaj/dataquest_exercises] I'm discussing some things as I learn along.

Last Saturday I completed the intermediate python course. You can check the flashy certificate in this [link](https://www.dataquest.io/view_cert/VYUXO1V1A9QCP0814R4E/).
