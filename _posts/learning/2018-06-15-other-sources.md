I'm doing online courses to train myself to become a data scientist. Everything I learn is from websites, Meetup meetings, online courses and books. It's hard to keep track of what I've read, I forget where I got *that useful bit of code* from.

So, in this post I want to keep a record of inspiring, useful pages from other coders around the world. I'm happy to hear suggestions for new sources of information, please get in touch.

- I signed up for [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). This is really useful and fun. You get challenges and you can see how other people solved them, so it's a nice way to learn better coding practices.

- I bought this book: [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do) by William McKinney, which is recommended in the pandas section in [StakOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/pandas/info). [McKinney](https://twitter.com/wesmckinn) is one of the creators of pandas.


- Fede Barabas. Most of what I learn comes from talking with [Fede](https://fedebarabas.github.io/).

- Reddit. This [r/datascience](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/) [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7a6ilh/whats_your_best_jupyter_notebook_tips_and_tricks/) has really cool, useful tricks and stuff for using Jupyter more efficiently.

- Dataquest: I'm doing the *Data Scientist In Python Path* at [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/dashboard). I found dataquest from [The 9 Best Free Online Big Data And Data Science Courses](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/06/06/the-9-best-free-online-big-data-and-data-science-courses/#63c6c8ab43cd) article at Forbes.

- I created this website using GitHub's [minimal mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) repo.

- [Leticia Portella](http://leportella.com/) has a really useful website for Python and data science.

- I learned some cool Matplotlib hacks from [Randy Olson](http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/28/how-to-make-beautiful-data-visualizations-in-python-with-matplotlib/)'s blog.

- I learned some cool pie chart trikcs from [Kevin Amipara](https://medium.com/@kvnamipara/a-better-visualisation-of-pie-charts-by-matplotlib-935b7667d77f)'s post.

- I'm listening to OCD [Machine Learning Guide](http://ocdevel.com/mlg) podcast.

- I'm doing Andrew NG's machine learning Coursera's [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
