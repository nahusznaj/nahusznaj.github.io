Working to use Zendesk as an agent through their API.

I'm getting started and first step was to install this python library: <http://docs.facetoe.com.au/zenpy.html>, which is mentioned in Zendesk's official docs for [API Clients](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/api-clients/python).

I may upload some scripts that I find useful.
