Twilio's Programmable Voice API is great! 

While you can download a CSV with all your calls, Twilio's console for voice calls doesn't provide a lot of data insights on count of calls.

With the python script from my repo [count incoming calls](https://github.com/nahusznaj/twilio-count-incoming-calls) that I wrote, you can count how many calls were made to your Twilio number in a given period of time. Please check the timezone settings in the repo. Let me know if I can help with Twilio!
