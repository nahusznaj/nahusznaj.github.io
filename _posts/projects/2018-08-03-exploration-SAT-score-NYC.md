Today I have completed another stimulating project: [Exploration of SAT scores and schooling in NYC](https://github.com/nahusznaj/Dataquest_Mission217_SAT_scores_NYC/blob/master/Schools.ipynb).

In this project I looked at SAT score performance for schools in NYC.

The project is part of [Dataquest.io](), Mission 217! You may find their solution [here](https://github.com/dataquestio/solutions/blob/master/Mission217Solutions.ipynb).

The [data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) is available online.
