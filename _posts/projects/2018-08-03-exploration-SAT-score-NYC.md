Find a Jupyter notebook with my project [Exploration of SAT scores and schooling in NYC](https://github.com/nahusznaj/Dataquest_Mission217_SAT_scores_NYC/blob/master/Schools.ipynb)

In this project I looked at SAT score performance for schools in NYC.


The project is part of [Dataquest.io]().

The data is available online at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4
