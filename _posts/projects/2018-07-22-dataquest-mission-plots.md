In this project I use a range of plot tools such as histograms, scatter plots, bar plots, with the libraries pandas, matplotlib and numpy. The dataset has information on job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012 in the USA. The original data on job outcomes was released by American Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their Github repo.

Find my [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/nahusznaj/5_Guided_Project_Dataquest) with the analysis.
