I put into practise fundamental statistical concepts with a nice dataset on film reviews.

Find my Jupyter notebook with the project in my [repo](https://github.com/nahusznaj/statistics_basic_fandango_films). Also, find a solution provided by dataquest.io in this [notebook](https://github.com/dataquestio/solutions/blob/master/Mission191Solutions.ipynb).

This is part of my [dataquest.io]() course in data science!

Feel free to get in touch and discuss further analysis!
