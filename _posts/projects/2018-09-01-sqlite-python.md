I've been learning SQL. This is an exercise analysing data from the [CIA world factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/), combining queries from SQL with python tools!

Find the jupyter notebook for my project on [Working with SQLite and Python](https://github.com/nahusznaj/sqlite-python-project/blob/master/Analysing_CIA_factbook_SQLite_python.ipynb).

This is part of my [dataquest.io]() course in data science!

Feel free to get in touch and discuss further analysis!
