Twilio is an awesome cloud communications platform.

Twilio's [Proxy API](www.twilio.com/docs/proxy) is a pretty rigid API that has basically one use-case: short-lived sessions where two participants interact via phone calls or messaging. The documentation in Twilio mentions SMS, but actually, this API can also be used for WhatsApp!
