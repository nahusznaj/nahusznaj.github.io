I've been learning SQL. This is an exercise analysing data from a fictional digital music shop, Chinook.  The Chinook [database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database) contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases. This information is contained in eleven tables.

Find my Jupyter notebook with this project in my [repo](https://github.com/nahusznaj/analysing_business_with_SQL). Also, find a solution provided by dataquest.io in this [notebook](https://github.com/dataquestio/solutions/blob/master/Mission191Solutions.ipynb).

This is part of my [dataquest.io]() course in data science!

Feel free to get in touch and discuss further analysis!
