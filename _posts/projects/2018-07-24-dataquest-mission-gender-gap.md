Find a Jupyter notebook and the data for my project on [Visualizing_Gender_Gap_College_Degrees](https://github.com/nahusznaj/Guided_Project_Visualizing_Gender_Gap_College_Degrees) that I did in my [dataquest.io]() data science course

You can find Dataquest's solution in their [repo]( https://github.com/dataquestio/solutions/blob/master/Mission149Solutions.ipynb)

Feel free to get in touch to discuss this!
